<p>Key chords (like <kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">x</kbd>) is the bane of keyboarding.
There are 3 types of key shortcuts to invoke commands in software:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Single key.  Examples include: <kbd class="dark">F1</kbd>, <kbd class="dark">PgUp</kbd>. 
</li>
<li>Key chord: <kbd class="dark"><kbd class="dark">⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">a</kbd> </kbd>,
   <kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">c</kbd>, <kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">z</kbd>, <kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">F</kbd>4.
</li>
<li>Key sequence of single keys or chords. For example on Microsoft
   Windows, 【F10 e c】 for copy, or 【<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">S</kbd>pace c】 to close window.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
of these, in terms of efficiency and hand he<kbd class="dark">alt</kbd>h (Repetitive Strain
Injury), the single key is the best. Key sequence of single keys is
second best. Key chord is the worst.
</p>

<p>
Key chord is the most hard on hand he<kbd class="dark">alt</kbd>h, but is also conceptually
the most convoluted.
</p>
<p>
I [Xah Lee] remember in around 1991, when i first learned about key
chord on the Macintosh Classic. I thought, it's strange. You have to
hold ⌘ Cmd first, then press the key c, then, release c, then, release
⌘ Cmd. It must be in that specific order.
</p>
<p>
A more natural way is either key sequence, or real chords. That is,
pressing several keys together but you don't have to worry about which
to hold or release first. Stenograph machines are like that.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-1"><kbd class="dark">W</kbd>hence Did Key Chord Came From?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1">

<p>I suppose, when computer keyboard came, sans levels and gears, but
habit stuck, and this evolved into “modifier” keys, with Bucky bits.
</p>
<p>
Now, thinking about this, i think Microsoft must be a genius, when
they invented the key system on Windows, where <kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd> is used to invoke
menu, and all command can be called by a sequence of key strokes. This
is probably the best system given the PC keyboard. This system, lets
you invoke any command, yet has menu counter-part, so it's easy to see
a list of them and also grouped by category. (emacs's system of course
is much more extensive than that.)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2"><kbd class="dark">W</kbd>hat Should a Keyboard Nerd Do with Key Chords?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2">

<p>BAN the them out of the universe.
</p>
<p>
But, there isn't enough keys on keyboard. You only have 12 function
keys, plus some others such as ↖ Home, ↓. But there are 10 times more
commands in software.  What to do?
</p>
<p>
For majority of commands, you should use a key sequence of single
keys, instead. For example, 【F10 e c】. But Function keys are further
away. So, you could start with a easy key such as 【▤ Menu e c】, and
reassign most of your keys to key sequence. (you can make Caps Lock as
your start key, whichever key on YOUR keyboard is easy to press.)
</p>
<p>
There are 26 letters in alphabet, plus 10 digits, so you have 36 key
choices for the key. (ignore punctuation keys for the moment) If each
of your command has 2 keys in a key sequence (not counting the
starting key), then you have 36 × 36 = 1296 possible keys for
commands. Quite enough!
</p>
<p>
Still, some commands are not suitable for key sequence. For example,
moving cursor by word. You want to be able to hold down a key and have
the cursor keep moving. You can't do that with key sequences, because
you need to release the key and press again to invoke the command
again. Answer: use single key. Retort: But F keys are far away and
arrow keys are already used. Answer: key chord then.

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3"><kbd class="dark">P</kbd>rinciples on Efficient Use of Key Chords</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3">

<p>Key chord should be used only for commands that need to be repeated
within a second (hold the key and let the command repeat).  This
includes moving cursor, paging, switching tab/window.
</p>
<p>
Key chord should use no more than one modifier. This saves your
hand. So, key chord such as emacs interactive replace 【<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">%</kbd>】
or Mac's redo 【⌘ Cmd+<kbd class="dark">⇧ Shift</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">z</kbd>】 should not be allowed.
</p>
<p>
more detail at Keyboard Shortcut Design: Repeatable vs Non-Repeatable
Commands and Keys
</p>
<p>
If you survey commands in a editor, such as emacs, vast majority of
commands are the non-repeating type. The repeating type are probably
less than 5% of commands. Using 【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">‹</kbd>letter/digit›】 key give you
about 36 spots. Adding <kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>, you have 72 spots. And that's more than
enough for repeating commands. In practice, i estimate a programer
uses less than 30 repeating commands per day on average.

<h4 id="sec-1-4"><kbd class="dark">W</kbd>hat About Sticky Keys?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-4">

<p>I do not advocate the Sticky Keys feature for the handicapped. It's
not the same. Sticky Keys actually make things a worse, because it's a
hack over key chords. When you press a sequence of keys, it has to
guess whether you mean a sequence or chord (since emacs supports
both). The end result is that it's confusing to use, imprecise, and
slows you down.

<h3 id="sec-2"><kbd class="dark">K</kbd>eyboard Shortcut Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2">

<p>This section discuss one criterion on the design of keyboard shortcut
system: Repeatable vs Non-Repeatable Commands and Keys. This
applicable in designing keybinding for emacs, vi, 3D modeling app, or
any app that has hundreds commands that needs to map to keys.

<h4 id="sec-2-1"><kbd class="dark">R</kbd>epeatable and Non-Repeatable Commands</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1">

<p>In my keyboarding research, there's a important discovery. Commands
can be classified into 2 types:
</p><ol>
<li>Repeatable commands. Commands that make sense to be repeated within
   a second. i.e. moving cursor by char, word, page. Page up/down. Delete
   by char, word. Expand selection, prev/next tab. You can hold down a
   key or a key-chord to repeat the command many times. 

</li>
<li>Non-repeat commands. This is vast majority. i.e. starting
   find/replace, open file, close file, list buffers, call a shell
   command or start shell, describe-function, keyword expansion or
   completion, list-matching-lines, sort-lines, kill-buffer,
   switch-to-buffer, &hellip;
</li>
</ol>


</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-2-2"><kbd class="dark">R</kbd>epeatable and Non-Repeatable Keys</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2">

<p>The Repeatable Commands must have keys that can be held down. Here's
example of repeatable hotkeys: F8, t, ⇟ Page ▽, ↓, 【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">t</kbd>】,
【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">8</kbd>】, ….
</p>
<p>
Non-repeatable hotkeys are basically keys that involves a sequence:
【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">x</kbd> 2】, 【F8 F9】
</p>
<p>
So, when designing a shortcut system, one of the principle is for
repeatable commands be on repeatable keys, else it's a waste. (because
you only have a few precious easy key spots, yet you have one hundred
commands in common use.)
</p>
<p>
In GNU Emacs's default keybinding, there are many such wastes. For
example, all 【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">‹</kbd>number›】 and 【<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">‹</kbd>number›】 are bound to
digit-argument. The digit-argument is a non-repeat command, yet it
sits on 20 EASY repeatable keys. (but most damaging is that
digit-argument isn't a frequently needed command, with respect to all
commands and the relatively few easy-key-spots.)
</p>
<p>
Another bad example is forward-page 【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">x</kbd> ]】. forward-page is a
repeatable command, but it doesn't have a repeating key. Imagine, if
every time you need to ⇟ Page ▽ that you have to press 【<kbd class="dark">Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">x</kbd>】
first. You couldn't just hold it down.
</p>
<p>
But remember, this “Repeatable and Non-Repeatable key” is only a
supporting criterion in keybinding design. It is not the most
important criterion. The single most important criterion in designing
a keyboard shortcut system is that most frequently used commands be
mapped to the most easy-to-press keys.

<h3 id="sec-3"><kbd class="dark">E</kbd>rgoemacs Key Chord Reduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3">


</div>

<div id="outline-container-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1">[Control+x] and [Control-c] reduction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1">

<p>For emacs, the most common prefixes are [Control-x] or [Control-c].
</p>
<p>
For QWERTY, an additional mapping of these keys have been made:
</p><ul>
<li>A modified Control-x map has been assigned to Menu f:
<ul>
<li>This map allows you to type the keys without a key chord
    requirement.  For example to switch buffers instead of
    [Control+x] [b] you could type [Menu] [f] [b].  (Note that the [f]
    key changes based on layout; For example using the colemak layout
    you would type [Menu] [t] [b] to switch buffers).

</li>
<li>This modified keymap changes the control-chorded keys to
    <kbd class="dark">alt</kbd>-chorded keys since they are easier to reach, there is another
    keymap that removes the control-chorded keys.  Therefore to get
    the buffer list, instead of having to type [Control-x]
    [Control-b] you can type [Menu] [f] [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>-b].

</li>
<li>The [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>-] keychords in this modified keymap are changed to
    [Control-] keys.  For example, <code>repeat-complex-command</code> is mapped
    from [Control-x] [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">:</kbd>] to [Menu] [f] [Control-:].  As far as I
    can tell this is the only [Control-x] [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>] combination. 

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>A modified unchorded Control-x map has assigned to QWERTY [Menu]
  [r].  This map has changed the Control-x map as follows:

<ul>
<li>Chorded control keys are subset.  Therefore only keys that have
    the combination [Control-x] [Control-] are used.

</li>
<li>Chorded key combinations are changed drop the chord.  For example
    the buffer list [Control-x] [Conrtol-b] is changed to [Menu] [r]
    [b].

</li>
<li>Chorded key combinations that are single key are translated to
    [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">]</kbd> for example [Control+k] [a] is changed to [Menu] [r] [k]
    [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">a</kbd>]

</li>
<li>Chorded key combinations that work with [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">]</kbd> are translated to
    [Control+].  For example [Control+k] [<kbd class="dark">Alt</kbd>+<kbd class="dark">a</kbd>] is changed to [Menu]
    [r] [k] [Control+a].  I don't think there are currently any keys
    bound to these types of key combinations.  They are quite
    difficult to press and remember.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>


<p>
Similarly The Control-c keymap is rebound to [Menu] [j] for the
modified [Control-c] keymap and [Menu] [u] for the unchorded
[Control-c] keymap.  This is also true of the [Control-h] keymap.
This is bound to [Menu] [h] for the normal Control-h keymap.  It is
also bound to [Menu] [y] for the unchorded Control-h keymap.

<h5 id="sec-3-2-1">Method #1 &ndash; &lt;menu&gt; Movement mode</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-3-2-1">

<p>One can enable movement without key-chords as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>On QWERTY, press [Menu] [k] and then the movement key.  This key is
  repeatable.  Therefore [Menu] [k] [k] [k] would move the cursor down
  two lines.  If this is followed by [i] this would have the cursor
  move up a line.  To exit the repeatable movement/delete keys press
  [Menu].  This is similar to VIM's edit mode, with a toggle of the
  [Menu] key.
<ul>
<li>Shifted keys still are allowed.  For example, page up can be
    accomplished in QWERTY by [Shift+i].
</li>
<li>Any command that enters the minibuffer also exits the repeatable
    movement/deletion.
</li>
<li>Any undefined key in the keymap (like 1) would exit the mode and
    insert the character
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>To reduce the shifted key-chords, on QWERTY you can also press
  [Menu] [i].  Therefore [Menu] [i] [i] is equivalent to one page
  up. Followed by a [k] will be the page-down equivalent
<ul>
<li>Again, [Menu] stops the movement mode and anything that enters
    the minibuffer removes the movement mode.
</li>
<li>Any undefined key in the keymap (like 1) would exit the mode and
    insert the character
</li>
<li>Shift and the key is the unshifted command.  Therefore [Menu] [i]
    [i] [Shift+k] would be Page Up followed by down one character.
